“What’s that supposed to mean?” she asked, knitting her eyebrows into a frown.
“Well, you’re a girl…” he said, all his confidence reflected in his expression.
“And you’re a boy.
What else is new?” she cut him off and crossed her arms on her chest, taking a few steps farther from him.

He surely didn’t mean what he said and looked like he wanted to apologize but decided to keep going because he knew it was the only way to persuade her to do something she would never do, and continued on with his rudeness: 
“Emily, you are not to deny that girls are scared of literally everything!”

Emily felt disgusted by this. But she was also in shock because her friend wasn’t normally like this – she knew him well enough to say he wasn’t sexist. But what was up with him – she had no idea.
“No, Charlie (she emphasized his name as he did with hers), that is not true. Girls just happen to not be afraid to show their feelings and are not embarrassed of them!” she stated.

“That is true. I can’t show you that I’m afraid,” he replied, narrowing his eyes at her, “Probably because I’m not. Unlike you.”

“What are you talking about? I, personally, am not scared to go wandering into an abandoned house of a mad photographer, who’s wife went missing and then so did he altogether with his son on the same week!” Emily retorted sarcastically.

“Alright then. Let’s go!” Charlie exclaimed, picked up his backpack and headed toward the freshly painted white fence.

The sun was setting and illuminated his dark silhouette as he reached the fence door with his hand. The light, warm spring breeze drifted through his short, untidy ash brown hair, making it flutter slightly as he smiled and motioned his head toward the road, separating Emily’s front yard from the other houses down the street.

Emily sighed and, knowing him for over eight years, she knew it would be impossible to convince him, now that he’s determined to do it, that this was a horrid idea.

“Fine,” she said grumpily and then, slightly cheering up and looking at him with a sort of sly smile, she added: “But tomorrow. After school.”

Charlie rolled his eyes but opened his mouth to agree, when Emily continued: “If…”  

Charlie looked at her disapprovingly.

“If you pass tomorrow’s biology test,” Emily was finally confident with her words.    

And so Charlie had to agree or else, he thought, he wouldn’t be able to explore the haunted house with his best friend.
 
He nodded reluctantly, lifted his skateboard from its leaning position against the fence, jumped over it instead of opening the door and set off into the sunset.
